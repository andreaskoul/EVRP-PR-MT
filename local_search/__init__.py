    """ Repeatedly apply ls_ops until no more improvements can be made. The
    procedure keeps track of the changed routes and searches only combinations
    that have been changed.

    Optionally the operator_strategy FIRST_ACCEPT (default)/BEST_ACCEPT can be
    given as well as the maximum number of iterations (that is, how many times
    all given operations are applied until giving up on reaching local optima).

    The iteration_strategy has an effect on which order the operations
    are applied. The default is ALL_ACCEPT (default), but the options are:

     * ITEROPT.FIRST_ACCEPT accepts every improving move found by the active
        operator, and after an improving move is found and made, it starts
        again from the first operator of the list. This is repeated until no
        operator finds any improvements.
     * ITEROPT.BEST_ACCEPT accepts the very best (single) move over all
        operators. Stops when no operator finds any improvements. This, when
        used together with operator_strategy=LSOPT.BEST_ACCEPT, will be the
        very steepest descent. However, it is also the most computationally
        heavy alternative as it has to evaluate every operator for each move.
     * ITEROPT.ALL_ACCEPT accepts every improving move of each operator it
        finds. It continues to the next operator after making that move or
        noting that there is no improvement to be made. The strategy stops when
        no operator finds any improvements.
     * ITEROPT.REPEATED_ACCEPT runs a single operator until no improving moves
        are found for it. Then, the strategy moves on to the next operator. The
        strategy starts again from the first operator if any of the operators
        found an improvement.

    Note that these may freely be combined with the operator_strategy.
